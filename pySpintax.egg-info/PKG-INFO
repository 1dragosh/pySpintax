Description: # pySpintax - The simplest Python Spintax spinner!
        
        With pySpintax, you can spin your Spintax text with just one line of code. 
        ###  Getting it
        
        To download pySpintax, simply use Pypi via pip.
        ```sh
        $ pip install pySpintax
        ```
        
        ### Using it
        
        Using pySpintax is extremely easy!
        
        ```Python
        from pySpintax import spin
        
        spintax = "{ Hi! | Hello! | Hey! }"
        spinned = spin(spintax)
        print(spinned)
        ```
        
        You can also change the delimiter of your Spintax text:
        
        ```Python
        from pySpintax import spin
        
        spintax = "{ Hi! ; Hello! ; Hey! }"
        spinned = spin(spintax, delimiter=";")
        print(spinned)
        ```
        
        pySpintax will strip whitespaces for you, so even if you have multiple whitespaces or none in your Spintax string, pySpintax will return a stripped String.
